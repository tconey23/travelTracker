### Challenges / Successes

## Challenges
- One of my main challenges with regards to this project was getting all of the moving pieces to work nicely together.
  One of my goals was to present this appl as one belonging to a luxury travel agency. That meant stretching my design skills to include crossfades, multiple images, and strateigc placement of elements on the screen

- The way the raw data was presented was also a challenge. As I went through the process of creating the application, I noticed quite often that what I felt an applicatioj like this needed to show, and what the data was limiting me to were two differnet things. For example splitting the user's first and last name, or correcting US states that were original input as countries.

## Successes
- Utilizing multiple different iterator methods including reduce, forEach, filter and find. Many of these had been a bit difficult to grasp at first, but using them in this project has been a tremendous help in the regard
- Figuring out how to crossfade transitions between different menus etc.
- Becoming much more comfortable with FETCH methods including POST, DELETE and GET
